## About The Project

![Main Page](./readme-images/main-page.png)

The News Flux is a Web Application built using React js and an APi from news api. It fetches the top headlines of different category and display them as a induvidual news item with a News source, Date of the news, Title, Description, Image realted to that News, and a read more button which direct the user to a different website to read more about that particular news. It has different categories in the Navbar, clicking on them shows user news related to that category. It also has a button to change the mode to Dark and Light Mode.

I have built this website by using different features of React js including React Hooks, React Context, React Router. React Hooks such as useState, useEffect. Create Context was used to make a context of dark mode and it has used in the whole component to manage the dark mode state. React Router was used to create routes for different news categories.
